### DESCRIPTION

        A simple example of key boards shortcuts implementation with javaScript.

        This project has no intention to be a complex implementation of binding
    javaScript events. The ideia became from the wrong speechs on the internet
    that says that javaScript can not bind many keys like shortcuts. Therefore,
    here is a very simple implementation that make it possible.

        All the actions after the bind keys recognized, stay with the programmer 
    creativity.
