KEY-BOARD-SHORT-CUTS

NAME
	key-board-short-cuts
	
DESCRIPTION

	A simple example of key boards shortcuts implementation with javaScript.

    This project has no intention to be a complex implementation of binding
    javaScript events. The ideia became from the wrong speechs on the internet
    that says that javaScript can not bind many keys like shortcuts. Therefore,
    here is a very simple implementation that make it possible.

    All the actions after the bind keys recognized, stay with the programmer 
    creativity.  

USAGE

    For a simple view test, copy the content of the 'keyBoardShortCuts.js' 
    file and paste it in the developer tool javaScript console on the browser.
    Then execute it. 

        Press 'ctrl' + 'left-arrow'    or,
              'ctrl' + 'right-arrow' to see the output console message.
